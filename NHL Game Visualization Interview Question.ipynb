If you are unfamiliar with the sport of Ice Hockey, it's simply a 60 minute game spread over three 20 minute periods. In each period teams compete to score goals against one another by skating around an ice rink and taking shots at a net which is defended by a goal tender. We would like to provide our coaching staff with some visualizations about the shots on net taken during the game. \n",
